# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML Manipulation

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to manipulating the `innerHTML` property of an HTML element.  Incorrectly appending to the existing `innerHTML` can lead to unexpected rendering issues.  The `bug.html` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected approach.

## Problem
The issue arises from directly appending new HTML content to an element's `innerHTML` using itself within the assignment. This can lead to the new content not being rendered correctly or unexpected behavior. 

## Solution
The solution involves creating a new string containing both the existing content and the new content, then assigning that to `innerHTML`. This approach ensures a cleaner and more predictable update of the element's content.
